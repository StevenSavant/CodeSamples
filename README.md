# Summary

This repo was originally used to store sample code from my college projects.
I have now repurposed it to store tutorials an useful code samples.
The tutorials here are mostly meant to help me re-enforce my own understanding as I learn new skills.
but hopfeully may help someone else out there. 

I will attempt to make tutorials specifically on things that are hard to Google or where looking up other tutorials
lead me to horribly complicated or hard to understand examples (to me). 


the `Java` and `Python` folders have old code from college. \
Please don't judge me for them.
